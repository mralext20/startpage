The name of this repo is a holdover from when it was much simpler.

before, it was a simple static site, using jquery to render normal humanreadable table into HTML. now, that HTML is hand written, and around 6kb of javascript is used to add a bit of functionality. 

# setup

on line 91/92 of index.html, you can switch between injesting javascript from the bundle, or from the app/ folder. 

to generate a bundle, `npm i`, then `npm run build`.
